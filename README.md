# QMK Keyboard Setup for dz60 with the neo layout

This repo gives you a qmk configuration for the [neo layout](neo-layout.org) to
be used with a dz60 keyboard.

It should be used together with the [qmk firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
To make this work put this repo into the `.../qmk_firmware/keyboards/dz60/keymaps/<your-new-keyboard>/`
folder, if you want to build it.
